This program simulates the Traffic Jam Game - A GUI implementation
This game is normally played in person as a team building sport where a number of people
are divided into two teams facing each other with an empty space separating each team.
Their mission is to get to the opponent’s side in the same order that they started out with.
## MOVES:
A jump is when a team member can move two spaces ahead to an empty space
A walk is when a team member can mode one space ahead to an empty space.
## RULES:
The Rules are simple.
1. At each turn only one team member can walk to an empty space but within the turn team members can jump to an empty space.
2. Team Members can only jump over an opponent.
3. Team Members cannot move backwards towards their origin.
# The GUI:
There are only a max of team members on each team. The default is 5. Players can choose
which team goes first and press Play to begin or choose the book Icon to read the rules.
The Code was written in Java Swing – had 1 week to learn it. It was fun but intense.

The Player may choose to **cheat** and have the AI **solve** the game by selecting the **unlock icon**.
The player may also choose to have the solved solution printed. Available as a text file which
will open and allow the user to choose the destination to print or save the file..
The player can also decide to restart the game and try again.

### Moves:
The teams are divided by color. The white space is the empty space as explained in the
introduction. Players much choose the team color and then select the white space as their
destination and select the walk icon or jump icon.
